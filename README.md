I recently completed an amazing tutorial by Code with Emily on YouTube about creating dynamic KPIs on an Excel dashboard, and I'm excited to share what I learned!

Thanks to this tutorial, I now have a solid grasp on how to create a visually appealing and interactive dashboard in Excel that allows me to easily monitor key performance indicators (KPIs).

Here are some of the key skills I learned through this tutorial:
